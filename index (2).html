        <li><h2>Bio</h2></li>
        <p>I was born on July 18th and raised in Chandigarh, where my lifelong fascination with 
            technology began. Growing up in a city known for its modern architecture and urban
             planning, I was inspired by the potential of technology to transform our world. This 
             ignited a deep passion within me to contribute meaningfully to the tech industry and 
             make a positive impact. From a young age, I immersed myself in the world of computers 
             and programming, realizing the immense power technology holds. Pursuing a formal 
             education in computer science provided me with a strong foundation in fundamental 
             principles and the skills needed to navigate the ever-evolving tech landscape. However,
              my passion extended beyond academics. I engaged in various projects, hackathons, and 
              collaborations, continuously seeking to expand my knowledge and skill set. </p>
        <p>Through these experiences, I discovered my true calling in using technology to solve 
                complex problems and drive innovation. Whether it was developing streamlined 
                applications, designing efficient algorithms, or exploring emerging technologies 
                like AI and blockchain, I consistently pushed the boundaries of what was possible.
                 Moreover, I recognized the significance of incorporating user-centric design and 
                 ethical considerations, ensuring that the solutions I created had a positive impact 
                 on people's lives.</p>
        <p> I progress in my career, I envision myself playing a pivotal role in shaping the future
             of the tech industry. My goal is to contribute to groundbreaking projects that 
             revolutionize sectors such as healthcare, education, sustainability, and more. 
             Alongside my technical expertise, I prioritize collaboration, innovation, and diversity,
              understanding that technology's true potential lies in its ability to bring people 
              together and address real-world challenges.</p>
        <p> Raised in Chandigarh, I am equipped with the knowledge, skills, and unwavering
             determination to make a difference. My journey as a tech enthusiast and computer scientist 
             has laid a solid foundation, and I am ready to leave a lasting impact on the world through
              my contributions to the tech industry.</p>
